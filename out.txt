Proposal: rename the nodejs/iojs-vi WG to nodejs/nodejs-vi



Dear members of the io.js Vietnamese WG `iojs-vi`

It is proposed to rename this repo to:

   [nodejs/nodejs-vi](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs-vi/)

As part of the io.js and node.js convergence, node.js releases are now based on the codebase and user base of the converged node.js and io.js communities. A number of the resources and repositories have already been renamed.
In the absence of objections or other discussion, this rename will occur on or after THREE WEEKS

However, active language working groups should take ownership of this issue and discuss/dispose of it according to their own processes.

For more information or to discuss the overall issue, please see and comment on https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/2525
